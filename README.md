# Devjobsapp
Here a frontend was created for a job board app named Devjobs to display the job listings and descriptions they have currently.

# Frontend
The entire project was built with React and TypeScript using Vite as the runtime environment and utilizes multiple common libraries for React like:
- React Hook Form
- React Query to query, cache, and make calls to the "API"
- React Router for client-side routing and for dynamic routes to display any given job


A Figma template and both icons and backgrounds were provided for the design by Frontend Mentor.
This project uses CSS modules with pure CSS to style all components.
